I am currently a senior security engineer at Alibaba Group. In 2021.6, I obtained my doctoral degree in Cryptography from Beihang University under the supervision of Prof. Jianwei Liu and Prof. Qianhong Wu. I was also trained at New Jersey Institue of Technology from 2019.9--2020.11, hosted by Prof. Qiang Tang. I got my bachelor degree in Mathematics from Beihang University. 
My research interests lie primarily in cryptography and data security techniques.
