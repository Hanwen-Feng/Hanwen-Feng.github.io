Hi! Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at the School of Computer Science, University of Sydney, hosted by Dr. Qiang Tang. Prior to joining USYD, I worked as a senior security engineer at Alibaba Group (2021-2022) and completed my PhD at Beihang University (2017-2021), with a visiting period at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (2019-2020).

My research interests span a broad range of topics in cryptography and security. In the past, I have worked on zero-knowledge proofs, randomness extractors, group and ring signatures, multiparty computation, and differential privacy.

Currently, I am primarily focused on cryptography and consensus challenges in distributed systems. My work aims to enhance the communication and computation efficiency of essential distributed consensus and cryptography protocols, such as distributed key generation, distributed common randomness, and Byzantine agreements, to enable their large-scale deployment.

I am currently on the job market for academic positions.
